Individual Wikipedia headings can be processed with either symbols as well. Please take note of the differences as follows: The hashtag (#) symbol will include a link to the related Wikipedia article with the snippet for user convenience, and convert Wikipedia headings with parentheses into 'the' snippets on copy (e.g. 'Us (2019 film)' --> 'the 2019 film Us'). The at sign (@) symbol will convert Wikipedia headings with parentheses into 'the' snippets on copy, but will not include a link to the related Wikipedia article."
